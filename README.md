# Bank-Loan-Eligibility-Prediction

The main aim of the project is to predict whether the bank approves loans for customers or not. To lend loans to customers, banks follow a set of rules and conduct background checks. In recent years, the number of loan applications has increased at a rapid rate. The approval of loans is always highly risky. Bank managers are well aware of the importance of customers repaying their loans. Loan approval decisions are not always correct, even after taking numerous measures and analyzing the loan application data. In this project, We predicted whether the bank can approve a loan for a customer or not based on a few parameters like customer education background, source of income, loan amount, and the credit history of the customer.  First, we preprocessed the data by applying feature engineering techniques. Then we used the Decision Tree Machine Learning algorithm on the preprocessed data to forecast whether the loan would be approved or not, and we calculated the algorithm's accuracy. The models are compared using a variety of measures, including Mean Square Error (MSE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) (RMSE).
